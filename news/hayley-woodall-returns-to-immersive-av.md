We’re delighted to announce that Hayley Woodall has returned to [Immersive AV](https://immersiveav.com/) as an Account Director. Hayley strengthens our team with her extensive knowledge of event technology and client requirements. Hayley’s cheery personality, can-do attitude and dedication to her work will augment the excellent service we strive to provide for all our clients.

Immersive AV Sales Manager, Scott Holman, said: *“It’s great to have Hayley back on board, her ability to build a rapport with clients and ensure they receive the equipment and services they need is second to none. Hayley was a key member of the team for nine years before the Coronavirus pandemic dealt its catastrophic hand to the events industry. As we recover and strengthen our team with new colleagues, it’s important to not only look for new faces, but also how we can create opportunities for some members of the team who we very sadly had to lose during the depths of the pandemic. However, Hayley’s appointment has been made on merit rather than sentimentality—very few other Account Directors have her capabilities and I’m honoured to have her in my team.”*

Discussing her return, Hayley said: *“I’m sure it will come as no surprise that the past 18 months have been tough, but I’m so excited to be back at Immersive AV, a business where I truly feel like part of the family. After a break from Immersive and the events industry, I know more than ever where my heart belongs—back at Immersive AV. I can’t wait to get back involved in planning events and helping our clients.”*

Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with Hayley if you’d like to discuss a brief or just to welcome her back to the team.
