We’re delighted to announce that Immersive AV are now a fully-fledged member of the Event Supplier and Services Association: [ESSA](https://www.essa.uk.com/). Whilst we’ve had a close relationship with the event industry’s leading trade body through our sister company ITR, the time is right for Immersive AV to be a member in its own right.

Immersive AV Sales Manager, Scott Holman said: *“ESSA is so important for the events industry, and it was essential for Immersive AV to join this magnificent partnership between the very best suppliers of goods and services to the industry. We’re keen to get stuck in and play an active part in supporting the events industry as we continue to recover from the effects of the pandemic.”*

*“It’s never been more important to be part of a collective than now. The benefits for event organisers and exhibitors choosing an ESSA member as one of their suppliers are clear: ESSA members are a tight knit community, committed to providing exemplary services. We share industry knowledge and continually review processes and procedures to ensure we produce gold-standard events.”*

*“Myself and the Immersive AV team are really excited for a busy autumn exhibition season and look forward to the opportunity of catching up with you on site.”*
